Overview

Companies around the world spend billions of dollars on marketing campaigns every year.  These investments typically revolves around conferences, seminars, workshops, round-tables and luncheons. Monetary outlays involve paying for the conference grounds, event management companies, agents and freelancers to do part of the executions, flights and hotels for staffs flying in, gifts, meals, handouts, and many other items that typically number in the range of tens of thousands to tens of millions per campaign. Also, many man-hours are spent in preparing the conference ground, in running the events, and in the networking between sales staffs and attendees.
